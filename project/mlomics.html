            Framing the investigation of diverse cancers as a machine learning problem has recently shown significant potential in multi-omics analysis and cancer research. Empowering these successful machine learning models are the high-quality training datasets with sufficient data volume and adequate preprocessing. However, while there exist several public data portals, these databases are not off-the-shelf for existing machine learning models. In this paper, we introduce MLOmics, an open cancer multi-omics database aiming at serving better the development and evaluation of bioinformatics and machine learning models. MLOmics contains 8,314 patient samples covering all 32 cancer types with four omics types, stratified features, and extensive baselines. Complementary support for downstream analysis and bio-knowledge linking are also included to support interdisciplinary analysis.

                "Abstract": "Ibrutinib is a first-in-class inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase. We previously reported the safety and short-term antitumor activity of ibrutinib in 20 patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (PCNSL) or secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL). We enrolled 26 additional patients with r/r PCNSL/SCNSL into the dose-expansion cohort of the trial into a combined cohort of 46 patients (31 with PCNSL and 15 with SCNSL). Patients received ibrutinib at 560 or 840 mg daily in the dose-escalation cohort and ibrutinib at 840 mg daily in the expansion cohort. The median follow-up was 49.9 and 62.1 months for patients with PCNSL and SCNSL, respectively. We sequenced DNA from available tumor biopsies and cerebrospinal fluid collected before and during ibrutinib therapy. Tumor responses were observed in 23/31 (74%) patients with PCNSL and 9/15 (60%) patients with SCNSL, including 12 complete responses in PCNSL and 7 in SCNSL. The median progression-free survival (PFS) for PCNSL was 4.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.8-9.2] with 1-year PFS at 23.7% (95% CI, 12.4%-45.1%). The median duration of response in the 23 PCNSL responders was 5.5 months. The median PFS in SCNSL was 5.3 months (95% CI, 1.3-14.5) with a median duration of response of 8.7 months for the 9 responders. Exploratory biomarker analysis suggests that mutations in TBL1XR1 may be associated with a long-term response to ibrutinib in PCNSL (P = 0.0075). Clearance of ctDNA from cerebrospinal fluid was associated with complete and long-term ibrutinib responses. Our study confirms single-agent activity of ibrutinib in r/r CNS lymphoma and identifies molecular determinants of response based on long-term follow-up.",

We examined 1,360 consecutive PDAC patients undergoing surgical resection and find that KRASG12R mutations are enriched in early-stage (stage I) disease, owing not to smaller tumor size but increased node-negativity. KRASG12R tumors are associated with decreased distant recurrence and improved survival as compared to KRASG12D. To understand the biological underpinnings, we performed spatial profiling of 20 patients and bulk RNA-sequencing of 100 tumors, finding enhanced oncogenic signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in KRASG12D and increased nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling in KRASG12R tumors. Orthogonal studies of mouse KrasG12R PDAC organoids show decreased migration and improved survival in orthotopic models. KRAS alterations in PDAC are thus associated with distinct presentation, clinical outcomes, and biological behavior, highlighting the prognostic value of mutational analysis and the importance of articulating mutation-specific PDAC biology.",

                "Abstract": "The digitization of health records and growing availability of tumour DNA sequencing provide an opportunity to study the determinants of cancer outcomes with unprecedented richness. Patient data are often stored in unstructured text and siloed datasets. Here we combine natural language processing annotations1,2 with structured medication, patient-reported demographic, tumour registry and tumour genomic data from 24,950 patients\u00a0at Memorial Sloan Kettering\u00a0Cancer Center to\u00a0generate a clinicogenomic, harmonized oncologic real-world dataset (MSK-CHORD). MSK-CHORD includes data for non-small-cell lung (n\u2009=\u20097,809), breast (n\u2009=\u20095,368), colorectal (n\u2009=\u20095,543), prostate (n\u2009=\u20093,211) and pancreatic (n\u2009=\u20093,109) cancers and enables discovery of clinicogenomic relationships not apparent in smaller datasets. Leveraging MSK-CHORD to train machine learning models to predict overall survival, we find that models including features derived from natural language processing, such as sites of disease, outperform those based on genomic data or stage alone as tested by cross-validation and an external, multi-institution dataset. By annotating 705,241 radiology reports, MSK-CHORD also uncovers predictors of metastasis to specific organ sites, including a relationship between SETD2 mutation and lower metastatic potential in immunotherapy-treated lung adenocarcinoma corroborated in independent datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of automated annotation from unstructured notes and its utility in predicting patient outcomes. The resulting data are provided as a public resource for real-world oncologic research.",

                AI agents tend to be conservative in hypothesis validation with higher rates of missed findings than false positives, with CodeGen showing Type II errors of 0.164 compared to Type I errors of 0.090 for Biomarkers. Reasoning-enhanced versions of both ReAct and CodeGen models consistently outperform their base counterparts, with ReAct-based methods generally achieving better results than CodeGen, particularly in complex domains like Genomics where reasoning augmentation reduced Type II errors from 0.191 to 0.107.

                (a): when CodeGen method makes non-exectuable code, it sometimes hallucinates the hypothesis as true or false, which should be non-verifiable.

            <p>
                (b): For non-verifiable hypotheses, we further found all agent methods make hallucinated hypothesis decision as true or false, while the ReAct based methods are more likely to make correct decision.
